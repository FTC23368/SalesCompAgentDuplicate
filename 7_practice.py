msg = "\n        Analysis Results\n        \n        Based on the data provided, a strong indicator of a seller’s effectiveness is how much they exceed (or fall short of) their sales quota. Calculating the ratio of Bookings to Quota for each rep gives us a clear picture:\n\n• John: Bookings = \\$4,000,000 vs. Quota = \\$10,000,000 → Attainment ≈ 40%\n• Dave: \\$5,000,000 vs. \\$15,000,000 → Attainment ≈ 33%\n• Sri: \\$3,000,000 vs. \\$20,000,000 → Attainment ≈ 15%\n• Ahmed: \\$9,000,000 vs. \\$25,000,000 → Attainment ≈ 36%\n• Yong: \\$20,000,000 vs. \\$30,000,000 → Attainment ≈ 67%\n• Susan: \\$10,000,000 vs. \\$35,000,000 → Attainment ≈ 29%\n• Chris: \\$45,000,000 vs. \\$40,000,000 → Attainment ≈ 112.5%\n• Mary: \\$50,000,000 vs. \\$45,000,000 → Attainment ≈ 111.1%\n• Anjana: \\$44,000,000 vs. \\$50,000,000 → Attainment ≈ 88%\n\nFrom these figures, it’s clear that Chris and Mary stand out. They have both exceeded their quotas by more than 100% (112.5% for Chris and 111.1% for Mary), which indicates that they are the most effective sellers in this dataset. Their ability to not only meet but significantly surpass their targets demonstrates strong performance and efficiency. Additionally, Mary earned the highest commission (\\$183,333), further supporting her effective performance.\n\nThe combination of high quota attainment and higher commission earnings underscores why Chris and Mary can be considered the top performers.\n        \n        Follow-up Suggestion\n        \n        Would you like to explore a visual comparison of quota attainment among all reps or analyze other performance metrics such as commission-to-bookings ratios?\n        \n        Would you like me to help with anything else about this data?\n        "
