10/31/24: 
- I worked on "feedback_collector_agent.py". 
- I've updated the code in this file. 
- I also worked on writing a detailed prompt. I used ChatGPT to refine my prompt. I think I should try to optimize all prompts for other sub-agents as well. However, I think I should do that carefully and do some sort of A/B testing to optimize the prompts.
