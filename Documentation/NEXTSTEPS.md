# NEXT STEPS WITH AMIT (Updated: 7/24):

1. Separate the Plan Design agent from Plan Explainer agent
2. Clean up the document database. There is a lot of duplication in Google Firestore.
3. Similar to Policy Agent, make sure that Plan Design and Plan Explainer agents are also using the full document set and not just RAG'd documents.
4. Activate log in functionality
5. Enable multi-tenant for Enterprise users
6. Update messaging on the landing page
