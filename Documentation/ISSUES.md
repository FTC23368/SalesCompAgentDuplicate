CURRENT ISSUES AND OPEN QUESTIONS:

1. Commission calculation appears formatted sometimes but occasionally it shows up with all markup. Continues to be inconsistent. (FIXED)

2. Ticket agent is still not ending the conversation the way I want it to. I have observed two issues:
    a. It sends two emails which are sent about 4 minutes apart.
    b. At the end, when it submits the form it responds back to the user what it sent in the email to generate a ticket. Ideally, what I'd like is that it sends the email with the summary of the issue and tells the user that it has submitted the ticket without responding with the issue summary. (FIXED)

3. I get a lot of warnings which are not real issues when I run the app.
